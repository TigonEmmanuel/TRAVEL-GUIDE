      <h2>The Early Days of the Web</h2>
      <p>In the early 1990s, web pages were primarily text-based, designed for the purpose of sharing information. The use of the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) allowed for the creation of the first web pages, which were simple and lacked stylistic flair.</p>

      <h2>The Introduction of CSS</h2>
      <p>The introduction of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) in the late 1990s revolutionized web design, allowing designers to separate content from presentation. This separation meant that web pages could not only serve information but also appeal visually to users, enhancing the user experience.</p>

The "mobile-first" approach, prioritizing mobile experience in design decisions, further emphasized the importance of adaptability in web design.</p>
