      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Renewable energy is becoming an increasingly important part of the global energy mix. With the threat of climate change, countries around the world are looking for sustainable solutions.</p>
      <p>Renewable energy comes from natural sources that don't run out, like sunlight, wind, and water. We're shifting towards renewables to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate climate change. Here's the lowdown:

    <section id="What is renewable Energy">
        <h2> what is renewable Energy</h2>
        <p>Renewable energy is generated from sources that are sustainable and non-depletable. We're talking about harnessing power from the sun, wind, water, and geothermal energy. These sources are cleaner and more environmentally friendly compared to fossil fuels.

    <section id="solar">
      <h2>Solar Energy</h2>
      <p>Solar power harnesses energy from the sun using photovoltaic cells. It is one of the fastest-growing sources of electricity worldwide.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="wind">
      <h2>Wind Power</h2>
      <p>Wind turbines convert kinetic energy from wind into mechanical power. It's clean, efficient, and a key player in future energy systems.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="challenges">
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      
        <p>Despite its benefits, renewable energy faces challenges like energy storage, grid integration, and fluctuating supply.</p>
        <p>Despite the benefits, renewable energy faces several challenges:</p>
<li>- Intermittency: Renewable energy sources like solar and wind are intermittent, meaning they're not always available when they're needed.</li>
<li>- Energy Storage: Storing renewable energy for later use is a significant challenge. We need to develop efficient and cost-effective energy storage solutions.</li>
<li>- Infrastructure: Widespread adoption of renewable energy requires significant investment in infrastructure, including transmission lines, storage facilities, and distribution networks.</li>
<li>- Policy and Regulation: Renewable energy policies and regulations vary widely across countries and regions, creating uncertainty and barriers to adoption.</li>
