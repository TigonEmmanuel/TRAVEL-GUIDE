    <p>The Municipal Chief Executive (MCE) for Nkwanta South has received widespread commendation following the successful cleaning and rehabilitation of a long-abandoned underpass in the municipality.</p>

    <p>For years, the underpass had remained in a state of disrepair, overrun by weeds, debris, and stagnant water—posing both health and safety risks to commuters and nearby residents. Its neglected condition had also contributed to limited pedestrian access and increased road hazards in the area.</p>

    <p>However, a recent initiative led by the MCE saw a full-scale cleanup of the site, with support from the Municipal Assembly’s environmental and sanitation teams. The project included clearing overgrown vegetation, desilting drainage channels, and restoring structural access through the underpass.</p>

    <p>Local leaders and community members have lauded the move, describing it as a long-overdue intervention that reflects a renewed commitment to infrastructure maintenance and public safety.</p>

      “We understand the frustration this underpass has caused over the years. Today marks a new beginning, and we remain committed to making Nkwanta South a cleaner, safer, and more connected municipality,” the MCE stated.

    <p>The cleanup forms part of a broader sanitation and urban renewal effort being rolled out in the region to improve living conditions and restore public trust in local governance.</p>
